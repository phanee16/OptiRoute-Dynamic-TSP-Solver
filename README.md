# Traveling_Salesman_Problem_real-time

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. It is an NP-hard problem that seeks to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. The problem is commonly used to model a wide range of real-world applications, including logistics, transportation, and routing problems.

The TSP has been extensively studied in the literature, and numerous algorithms have been proposed to solve it. The most straightforward approach is to use a brute force algorithm that generates all possible permutations of the cities and calculates the length of each route. However, this approach becomes computationally intractable for large numbers of cities.

To solve the TSP for large numbers of cities, several heuristic algorithms have been developed. These algorithms are designed to quickly find a near-optimal solution that is close to the global optimum. One of the most popular heuristic algorithms for the TSP is the nearest neighbor algorithm, which constructs a tour by starting at a random city and repeatedly visiting the closest unvisited city until all cities have been visited.
